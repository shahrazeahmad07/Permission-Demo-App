# Permission-Demo-App
An application that shows how to get resource permission from users.

So, it uses ActivityResultLauncher to get the permissions from the user.
there are two types of implementation of this class.
1 to get single permission and the other to get multiple resources permission from the user.

If the user denies a permission, the app shows a dialogue to open the settings of the app to allow permissions and opens settings of the app.

This project has both implementations.
